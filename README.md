## 👋 Software Developer @ 42 Istanbul | C & JavaScript Enthusiast

I’m a passionate software developer based in Istanbul, Turkey, currently studying the **Common Core** at [42 Istanbul](https://42istanbul.com.tr).

I love being part of any computer‑programming project. My favorite languages are **C** and **JavaScript**; I enjoy building things from scratch and digging into how systems really work. I’m also a big fan of open‑source development and share many of my projects right **[here](https://github.com/ahmettzorlutuna?tab=repositories)** on GitHub.

Feel free to explore, open an issue, or just say hello!
